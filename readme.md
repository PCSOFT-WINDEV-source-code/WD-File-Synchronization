<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">This example is used to synchronize two file directories in WLanguage. After the synchronization, the destination directory and the source directory are identical. The comparison is based on the presence and on the date of the files. This can be very useful to manage the backups.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">In this example, we will present the functions for handling the files on disk.</span>

  
<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Summary of the example supplied with WINDEV: </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Select a source directory containing the files to save and a destination directory where these files will be saved. Start the synchronization. The application will compare the content of the two directories. If the file is not found, if the source file is more recent, then the file will be updated in the backup directory.</span>
